We offer MS and BS thesis topics for students with a strong interest in robotics who are already enrolled at TU Berlin.
We do not maintain a fixed list of topics; instead, we offer customized topics based on mutual interest and technical background.
Our highest priorities are that students learn new technical and theoretical skills and enjoy their time working on the thesis.
Good mentoring takes time (we meet with our students at least one hour per week); we therefore can only mentor a few students.

If you are interested in working with us, please contact <a href="mailto:hoenig (at) tu-berlin (dot) de">Wolfgang HÃ¶nig</a> with a motivation letter.
In your letter, please describe why you are interested, your technical background, and potential projects of interest (if any).
For us, your enthusiasm for the research area and a desire to participate in a research lab is of utmost importance.
We are a highly interdisciplinary and diverse team and we explicitly encourage applications from underrepresented groups.
