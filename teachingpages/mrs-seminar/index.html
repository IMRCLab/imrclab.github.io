    The course focuses on applications of multiple robots and robotic swarms, e.g., for inspection, exploration, assembly, or surveillance. Compared to a single robot, new challenges arise in all parts of the robotics pipeline: perception and state estimation (of other robots), decision making (collision avoidance and achieving a common goal), and controls (safety or other guarantees). We consider classic seminal and current book chapters and scientific papers that tackle these challenges both from a theoretical and a practical/application perspective.

    <ul>
      <li>Decision Making (e.g., Assignment algorithms, path and motion planning, Dec-POMDPs)</li>
      <li>Controls (e.g., collision avoidance, rigidity and formation control)</li>
      <li>Perception/State Estimation (e.g., relative pose estimation, multi-robot SLAM)</li>
      <li>Applications/field robotics (e.g., environment monitoring, assembly planning, exploration and mapping)</li>
    </ul>
