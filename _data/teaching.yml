    note: |
      Course held by Prof. Marc Toussaint. We mentored one out of five students.

      After attending the module, students have extensive experience with working in a research lab on specific topics of current research in Learning & Intelligent Systems. They have in-depth knowledge and practical understanding of the specific topic they work on during the project. They are capable of conceptualizing a research project, formulating a realistic workplan, and managing the research work autonomously.

      New course designed by Dr. Wolfgang Hönig and Dr. Andreas Orthey.

      Motion planning is a fundamental building block for autonomous systems, with applications in robotics, industrial automation, and autonomous driving.

      After completion of the course, students will have a detailed understanding of:
      • Formalization of geometric, kinodynamic, and optimal motion planning;
      • Sampling-based approaches: Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) and probabilistic roadmaps (PRM);
      • Search-based approaches: State-lattice based A*;
      • Optimization-based approaches: Sequential convex programming;
      • The theoretical properties relevant to these algorithms (completeness, optimality, and complexity).

      Students will be able to:
      • Decide (theoretically and empirically) which algorithm(s) to use for a given problem;
      • Implement (basic versions) of the algorithms themselves;
      • Use current academic and industrial tools such as the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL).
