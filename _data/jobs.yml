  #   hours: TV-L 13, 100 %
  #   deadline: Full consideration until August 4 (until filled thereafter).
  #   reference:  	IV-186/23
  #   announcement: https://tub.stellenticket.de/en/offers/170235
  #   note: |
  #     In our research we investigate artificial intelligence techniques that enable decision making (task planning, motion planning, and controls) in high-dimensional search spaces. We are motivated by aerial robots, which need to coordinate safely and efficiently in congested environments. Our goal is to develop the algorithmic foundations, both theoretical and practical, that will enable future robot swarms to autonomously conduct search-and-rescue missions, advance just-in-time manufacturing, and function as aerial robot delivery systems.

  #         • Strong programming skills, preferably in C++, Python, or Julia
  #         • Excellent communication
  #         • Excellent written and spoken English
  #         • Above all, enthusiasm for the research area and a desire to develop cutting-edge solutions to challenging real-world problems

  #     Desirable:
  #         • Knowledge of trajectory optimization, informed search, machine learning, or planning
