    note: |
      In our research we investigate artificial intelligence techniques that enable decision making in high-dimensional search spaces. We are motivated by aerial robots, which need to coordinate safely and efficiently in congested environments. Our goal is to develop the algorithmic foundations, both theoretical and practical, that will enable future robot swarms to autonomously conduct search-and-rescue missions, advance just-in-time manufacturing, and function as aerial robot delivery systems.

      Requirements:
          • Successfully completed university degree (Master, Diplom or equivalent) in robotics, computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, or a related discipline with outstanding performance
          • Strong analytical skills (such as linear algebra, calculus, AI theory)
          • Strong programming skills, preferably in C++, Python, or Julia
          • Excellent communication
          • Excellent written and spoken English
          • Above all, enthusiasm for the research area and a desire to develop cutting-edge solutions to challenging real-world problems

      Desirable:
          • Knowledge of trajectory optimization, informed search, machine learning, or planning
          • Experience with multi-agent or multi-robot systems
          • Experience with unmanned aerial vehicles (e.g., Crazyflie, PX4, Arducopter) or other robotic systems
          • Experience with the Robot Operating System (ROS)
          • Experience with embedded systems (e.g., firmware development in C)
          • Working knowledge of Linux
